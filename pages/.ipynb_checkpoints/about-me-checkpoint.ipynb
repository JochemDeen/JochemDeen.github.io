    "I started out studying engineering physics in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. During an internship in Albany, New York I got interested in making devices for biological applications. At the time there was a young professor who started out making all sorts of cool bioMEMS devices. This experience made me pursue a master in biophysics. The program director of the biophysics program of KU Leuven pursuaded me to come to Leuven where I spent a little over 7 years. For my master thesis I joined the lab of prof. Johan Hofkens where I continued together with Rob Neely to work on high resolution DNA mapping (at the time also the title of my PhD thesis). After my PhD I joined the lab of prof. Theo Lasser in EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, to continue working on DNA mapping but now focused on the microscope side of the method. After one year I received a Marie Curie fellowship to work in the lab of prof. Aleksandra Radenovic, where I am now!\n",
